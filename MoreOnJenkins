## Adding a slave/node/Agent..

## Delegation for tasks between master and agent is fairly automatic
## However you can dictate if you want a particular agent for specific job
 su jenkins -s /bin/bash
 ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa):

Create a slave server
ssh to slave
sudo su
useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins
mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
vi /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys
--- Copy the earlier generated key from master ----
install java on this slave

rpm -Uvh jdk-8u121-linux-x-64.rpm

Go to master
manage-jenkins->manage nodes->new node
--give a name to slave and add as permanent agent
